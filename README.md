### Installation

* via PyPI

    `pip install bdownload`

* from within source directory locally

    `pip install .`
    
    Note that you should `git clone` or download the source tarball (and unpack it of course) from the repository first 

### Usage: as a Python package

#### Importing

    `from bdownload import BDownloader`

            or

    `import bdownload`

#### Signatures

`
class bdownload.BDownloader(max_workers=None, min_split_size=1024*1024, chunk_size=1024*100, proxy=None, cookies=None,
                            user_agent=None, logger=None, progress='mill', num_pools=20, pool_maxsize=20, request_timeout=None,
                            request_retries=None, status_forcelist=None, resumption_retries=None, continuation=True, referrer=None,
                            check_certificate=True, ca_certificate=None, certificate=None)
`

    Create and initialize a `BDownloader` object for executing download jobs.
  
  * The `max_workers` parameter specifies the number of the parallel downloading threads, whose default value is 
    determined by _#num_of_processor * 5_ if set to `None`.
  
  * `min_split_size` denotes the size in bytes of file pieces split to be downloaded in parallel, which defaults to 
    1024*1024 bytes (i.e. 1MB).
  
  * The `chunk_size` parameter specifies the chunk size in bytes of every http range request, which will take a default 
    value of 1024*100 (i.e. 100KB) if not provided.
  
  * `proxy` supports both HTTP and SOCKS proxies in the form of _http://[user:pass@]host:port_ and 
    _socks5://[user:pass@]host:port_, respectively.
  
  * If `cookies` needs to be set, it must either take the form of _cookie_key=cookie_value_, with multiple pairs separated
    by whitespace and/or semicolon if applicable, e.g. '_key1=val1 key2=val2;key3=val3_', be packed into a `dict`, or 
    be an instance of `CookieJar`, i.e. `cookielib.CookieJar` for Python27, `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` for Python3.x or 
    `RequestsCookieJar` from `requests`.
    
    Note that the `ValueError` exception will be raised when the `cookies` is of the `str` type and not in the valid format.
  
  * When `user_agent` is not given, it will default to '_bdownload/VERSION_', with _VERSION_ being replaced by the 
    package's version number.
  
  * The `logger` parameter specifies an event logger. If `logger` is not `None`, it must be an object of class 
    `logging.Logger` or of its customized subclass.  Otherwise, it will use a default module-level logger returned by 
    `logging.getLogger(__name__)`.
  
  * `progress` determines the style of the progress bar displayed while downloading files. Possible values are `'mill'`,
    `'bar'` and `'none''`. `'mill'` is the default. To disable this feature, e.g. while scripting or multi-instanced, 
    set it to `'none'`.
  
  * The `num_pools` parameter has the same meaning as `num_pools` in `urllib3.PoolManager` and will eventually be passed
    to it. Specifically, `num_pools` specifies the number of connection pools to cache.
  
  * `pool_maxsize` will be passed to the underlying `requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter`. It specifies the maximum number of 
    connections to save that can be reused in the urllib3 connection pool.

  * The `request_timeout` parameter specifies the timeouts for the internal `requests` session. The timeout value(s) 
    as a float or `(connect, read)` tuple is intended for both the `connect` and the `read` timeouts, respectively.
    If set to `None`, it will take a default value of `(3.05, 6)`.
    
  * `request_retries` specifies the maximum number of retry attempts allowed on exceptions and interested status codes
    (i.e. `status_forcelist`) for the builtin Retry logic of `urllib3`. It will default to `download.URLLIB3_BUILTIN_RETRIES_ON_EXCEPTION`
    if not given.
    
    NB: There are two retry mechanisms that jointly determine the total retries of a request. One is the above-mentioned
    Retry logic that is built into `urllib3`, and the other is the extended high-level retry factor that is meant to 
    complement the builtin retry mechanism. The total retries is bounded by the following formula:
    `request_retries` * (_requests_extended_retries_factor_ + 1), where _requests_extended_retries_factor_ can be modified
    through the module level function `bdownload.set_requests_retries_factor()`, and is initialized to 
    `download.REQUESTS_EXTENDED_RETRIES_FACTOR` by default; Usually you don't want to change it.
    
  * `status_forcelist` specifies a set of HTTP status codes that a retry should be enforced on. The default set of status
    codes shall be `download.URLLIB3_RETRY_STATUS_CODES` if not given.
    
  * The `resumption_retries` parameter specifies the maximum allowable number of retries on error at resuming the interrupted
    download while streaming the request content. The default value of it is `download.REQUESTS_RETRIES_ON_STREAM_EXCEPTION` 
    when not provided.
    
  * The `continuation` parameter specifies whether, if possible, to resume the partially downloaded files before, e.g. 
    when the downloads had been terminated by the user by pressing `Ctrl-C`. When not present, it will default to `True`.
  
  * `referrer` specifies an HTTP request header `Referer` that applies to all downloads. If set to `'*'`, the request URL
    shall be used as the referrer per download.

  * The `check_certificate` parameter specifies whether to verify the server's TLS certificate or not. It defaults to `True`.

  * `ca_certificate` specifies a path to the preferred CA bundle file (.pem) or directory with certificates in PEM format
    of trusted CAs. If set to a path to a directory, the directory must have been processed using the `c_rehash` utility
    supplied with OpenSSL, according to `requests`. NB the cert files in the directory each only contain one CA certificate.

  * `certificate` specifies a client certificate. It has the same meaning as that of `cert` in `requests.request()`.

`
BDownloader.downloads(path_urls)
`

    Submit multiple downloading jobs at a time.
  
  * `path_urls` accepts a list of tuples of the form (_path_, _url_), where _path_ should be a pathname, probably prefixed
    with absolute or relative paths, and _url_ should be a URL string, which may consist of multiple TAB-separated URLs 
    pointing to the same file. A valid `path_urls`, for example, could be [('_/opt/files/bar.tar.bz2_', '_https://foo.cc/bar.tar.bz2_'),
    ('_./sanguoshuowen.pdf_', '_https://bar.cc/sanguoshuowen.pdf\thttps://foo.cc/sanguoshuowen.pdf_'), 
    ('_/**to**/**be**/created/_', '_https://flash.jiefang.rmy/lc-cl/gaozhuang/chelsia/rockspeaker.tar.gz_'), ('_/path/to/**existing**-dir_',
    '_https://ghosthat.bar/foo/puretonecone81.xz\thttps://tpot.horn/foo/puretonecone81.xz\thttps://hawkhill.bar/foo/puretonecone81.xz_')].
    
    Note that `BDownloaderException` will be raised if the downloads were interrupted, e.g. by calling
    `BDownloader.cancel()` in a `SIGINT` signal handler, in the process of submitting the download requests.

  > **:warning:**\
  > The method is not thread-safe, which means it should not be called at the same time in multiple threads
  > with one instance.
  >
  > When multi-instanced (e.g. one instance per thread), the file paths specified in one instance should not overlap 
  > those in another to avoid potential race conditions. File loss may occur, for example, if a failed download task 
  > in one instance tries to delete a directory that is being accessed by some download tasks in other instances.
  > However, this limitation doesn't apply to the file paths specified in a same instance.

`
BDownloader.download(path, url)
`

    Submit a single downloading job.
  
  * Similar to `BDownloader.downloads()`, in fact it is just a special case of which, with [(`path`, `url`)] composed of
    the specified parameters as the input.
    
    Note that `BDownloaderException` will be raised if the download was interrupted, e.g. by calling
    `BDownloader.cancel()` in a `SIGINT` signal handler, in the process of submitting the download request.
    
  > **:warning:**\
  > The limitation on the method and the `path_name` parameter herein is the same as in `BDownloader.downloads()`.

`
BDownloader.wait_for_all()
`

    Wait for all the downloading jobs to complete. Returns a 2-tuple of lists (_succeeded_, _failed_).
    The first list _succeeded_ contains the originally passed (_path_, _url_)s that completed successfully, while
    the second list _failed_ contains the raised and cancelled ones.

`
BDownloader.results()
`

    Get both the succeeded and failed downloads when all done or interrupted by user. Return a 2-tuple of list
    same as that returned by `BDownloader.wait_for_all()`.

`
BDownloader.result()
`

    Return the final download status. 0 for success, and -1 failure.

`
BDownloader.close()
`

    Shut down and perform the cleanup.

`
BDownloader.cancel(keyboard_interrupt=True)
`

    Cancel all the download jobs.

  * `keyboard_interrupt` specifies whether the user hit the interrupt key (e.g. Ctrl-C).

`
bdownload.set_requests_retries_factor(retries)
`

    Set the retries factor that complements and extends the builtin retry mechanism of `urllib3`.

  * The `retries` parameter specifies the maximum number of retries when a decorated method of `requests` raised an 
    exception or returned any bad status code. It should take a value of at least `1`, or else nothing changes.
